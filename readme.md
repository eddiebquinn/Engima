# Enigma machine

The Enigma machine is a cypher device developed and used by the German military during the second world war. It works using an electro-mechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters in the alphabet, alongside a plugboard which swaps letters as they go in and out of the rotors.

This project was/is my attempt to recreate the Engima machine in python. I decided to do this for two key reasons

1) **I have always found the enigma machine interesting**
Fundamentally the enigma machine is not too complex, and yet it causes the allies immense headache for allied forces before it was cracked in Bletchley Park. It was one of the first methods of encoding messages I found out about as a child, and I have always wanted to make my own (thus here we are).

2) **It lends itself to me learning a harder language**
I've wanted to learn a harder language for a while, and this project lends itself to me doing so. Once I code the Python version, I will begin to learn the other language, and once I am confident enough, I transition the code from Python into it.  The reason I am choosing this path is that I learn best by doing projects. If I already know how a project is meant to work and act, then it makes it easier to code.
